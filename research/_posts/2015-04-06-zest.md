Zest is an emergent construct in psychology research representing the approach to life with excitement, energy, and anticipation. Weâ€™re proud to emphasize zest in our programming, and are thrilled to see the development of zest in our students and schools. To learn about the latest with zest, explore the research of Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman.

School culture comprises the rituals, values, and norms that define a school. At The Future Project, we believe the success and happiness of individuals is influenced by school culture and visa versa, so our work actively accounts for this interplay between the individual and the collective. To learn more about the power of school culture, explore the research of David H. Hargreaves, Kent D. Peterson, and Terrence E. Deal.

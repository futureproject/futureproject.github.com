Purpose in adolescence is defined as having a far reaching goal that is both an individual’s search for meaning but that also contributes to the world beyond the self. Our Dream Directors actively support students to identify their purpose and to develop projects or organize events that engage it. We’re excited to be working with Bill Damon of The Stanford Center on Adolescence in our efforts to develop purpose in young people.

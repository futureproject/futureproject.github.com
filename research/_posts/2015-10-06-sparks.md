Sparks are defined as an activity or cause that generates passion, joy, energy, and purpose in someone. Research on sparks indicates that youth who have an adult who supports their sparks are more successful in school and beyond. Weâ€™re excited to be using cutting edge instruments from the Search Institute to assess spark in relation to other key areas like growth-mindset.

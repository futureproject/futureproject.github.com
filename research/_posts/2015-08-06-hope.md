In research, hope involves the optimistic belief and ability to initiate and sustain progress towards goals. It is intertwined with self-efficacy and growth-mindset. The Future Project cultivates a positive atmosphere with the intent to encourage students to be optimistic about their future. Weâ€™re excited to partner Shane Lopez, Senior Scientist at Gallup and author of Making Hope Happen.

Students who master the five main SEL skills—self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, responsible decision making, and relationship skills—are better able to operate within social contexts and generate support from the people and resources around them. We’re thrilled to be working with Tim Shriver and The Collaborative for Academic and Social Emotional Learning (CASEL) to better develop these skills in our students.

Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed, but it can also apply to seeing potential for growth in many aspects of oneself or the surrounding world. Students that exhibit growth mindset have an innate desire to learn, and are more likely to embrace challenges, learn from criticisms, and persist in the face of setbacks in and out of academic settings. As Dream Directors work with students to pursue their purpose and sparks, the dream directors explicitly emphasize how to have a growth mindset regarding the inevitable challenges in life. In developing growth mindset, weâ€™ve partnered with Carol Dweck, growth mindset pioneer and author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.

We designed the new role of the Dream Director over the past three years in concert with thousands of students, teachers, principals, academics, and social entrepreneurs across America—and we solidified it by holding sacred a simple principle: that human values belong at the center of a school—and, more broadly, American education.

Dream Directors are embedded in schools, and work in tandem with students and faculty members to reimagine them as places of possibility and action. They provide action-based coaching and skill-centered learning experiences. They support students in small groups, and one-on-one, to launch their dreams. And they collaborate day after day with their principal to transform culture, space, and policy.

We believe that the people within schools, from students to teachers to custodians to principals, are ready to do extraordinary things. The Dream Director stands for the possibility of all people, and they step up daily to the steep but urgent challenge of reimagining the status quo.  The results of this work takes many inspiring forms, from student Future Projects—campaigns, organizations, products, events, and so much more—to physically redesigned schools and entirely new classes at the school. Students gain the will to succeed and the skills to lead. Schools become thrilling. New connections are formed within a school and across a community. Ripples of hope are sent forth from classrooms to community to city. 

If you believe anything is possible, then you may be a Dream Director. We imagine Dream Directors one day in every school in America. Apply now to be one of the first.

We want to not just question the *how* of education, but also the *what* of it. Our hypothesis is simple:

**When we trust young people to create the lives they have long imagined – and focus on inspiring them to see what that life could be in the first place – they step up to the challenge.**

That’s why we invented a new character for a school called the **Dream Director**, one of the first new full-time jobs in a school since the guidance counselor was developed and democratized in 1907.

A Dream Director is an agent of transformation who does not come with answers but with questions. What’s your passion? What change do you want to see in the world? How can you start enacting that now? They cultivate in students – and teachers – the courage and confidence to imagine new possibilities and the skills to enact them: skills they will need for the rest of their lives – especially as more and more of the traditional jobs disappear.

We’ve seen students create films, write books, start organizations, launch clubs, transform their cities, and kickstart movements. They remind us of what is possible when young people start to question the assumptions we’re taught about success – and define it on their own.

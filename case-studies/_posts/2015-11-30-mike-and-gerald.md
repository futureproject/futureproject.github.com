    quote: Think huge! Don’t think small. I didn’t even think going on tour was possible. It was a joke at first! We said "we are going to do a tour and go to different cities" and then we were like,  “how is this possible!”. But we were able to do it. So think big!

Mike Rivera and Gerald Conyers dreamed of performing their original hip-hop music in front of crowds across the country. So in their junior year of high school, they created the NextUp Tour, a multi-city concert tour that put them on stages from New Haven, CT down to Washington D.C. They wanted to be an example to other people to show them that organizing something crazy, and seemingly impossible, could happen if you dedicate yourself to it and work hard. In all, they performed for 800-1,000 young people at shows in more than 5 cities. Through the tour, they reinforced their own skills as performers and music lovers, and understood how music is a powerful medium for inspiring other young people to take action. Their senior year, they launched the NextUp Tour 2—and continued making music for audiences across the northeast. Through their travels, the duo has met hip-hop icons like Drake, Soulja Boy, Birdman, and more. 

Mike is currently a freshman at Central Connecticut State University at their school for business, still working on his music. He goes to the studio every week, and he is performing on campuses near his school. Mike and Gerald are now planning a College Tour as the next iteration of their project.

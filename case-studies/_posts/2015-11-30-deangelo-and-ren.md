After meeting and befriending Lucas, a boy with intellectual disabilities, Craig realized that he wanted to stand up for a group of people who he saw feel isolated and treated poorly. He noticed that students at his school did not understand what people with disabilities were capable of doing, and he decided that he wanted to bring students together to promote community. So this past spring, Craig launched The Lucas Project, a carnival-style event with food, dancing, games, and more to unite students with and without disabilities at his school. More than 200 students from his school and a neighborhood school for students with special needs came together for the event. 

After this successful inaugural Lucas Project event, Craig is determined to continue to spread a message of unity and community in the city of Detroit. This summer, Craig got the opportunity to pitch his project at the Special Olympics World Games Youth Summit. This year, he hopes to hold events at other schools, add more activities (such as a talent show), and bring in athletes and coaches from the Special Olympics in Michigan.

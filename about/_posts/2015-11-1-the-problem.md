America’s education system calibrates – really, programs – young people to pursue a vision of success that has nothing to do with real success in life, at least life in the 21st Century.

- We teach students algebra but not the art of aspiration, and then wonder why they don’t dream beyond their circumstance.
- We teach students how to critically think, but then challenge them to apply that to pointless passages on tests, rather than the biggest problems in their communities, and wonder why our world seems stuck.
- We promise teachers the opportunity to inspire their students to seek knowledge and live curiously – to light the fire – and we measure them based on how much they’ve informed those students about information they could look up on Google.

### Then we wonder why so many students drop out of school – and never even want to go to college in the first place.

They’re the smart ones. Our education system, it turns out, is one big lie – and it’s not the fault of any one actor within it. In fact, it’s our fault – because as much as we say it is time to reimagine education, we keep sending our kids to school and keep paying those college tuition bills – and too often pretend that school served a purpose that it never did.

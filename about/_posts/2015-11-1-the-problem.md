## Our country is uninspired, unfulfilled, and losing hope.

America is supposed to be a place of possibility. But amid major challenges, our society has become more pessimistic than ever before. Worst of all, millions of young people are growing up hopeless and disengaged, without the belief or the skills they need to lead in the 21st century.

1. #### Millions of Americans are living unhappy, unfulfilled lives and don’t have faith in the future.
  - 2/3 say they are unhappy with their lives.
  - More than half say they are unfulfilled in their jobs.
  - Nearly 2/3 believe the next generation will be economically worse off that they are today.

2. #### This is most dangerously true for young people, who do not believe they can build a better future.
  - 7/10 young people say they are uninspired and unmotivated.
  - 5/10 say they are not hopeful about their futures.

3. #### This is being reinforced by schools across America, which are designed to prepare students for the past, not the future.
  - Most aspects of today’s public schools in America were designed in 1892.
  - Students lose more than 90% of their creative capacity during their school years.
  - 65% of students will be employed in jobs that don’t exist yet and for which schools are not preparing them.

4. #### This is causing young people to disengage at staggering numbers and never discover and unleash their full potential.
  - Only 55% of students are engaged in learning at school.
  - 1.2 million students drop out of American high schools every year (that’s 7000 each day).
  - Suspension rates have more than doubled in the past four decades, contributing to a strong school to prison pipeline.

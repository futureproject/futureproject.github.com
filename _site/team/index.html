        <p>As a 4th generation teacher-scholar, Kenya’s work is articulated by the African Proverb, “She who learns, teaches.” This paradigm is influenced by the historiography of indigenous cultures of the world and contemporary movements. As an educator, Kenya has serviced New York City, Philadelphia, and several international communities: Ghana, Tanzania, Ethiopia, South Africa, Cuba, Nigeria, Brazil, India and Puerto Rico. She has always understood her learnings in Africana Studies, along with her professional experiences and civic engagement to be manifestations of her essential commitment to education, cultural advocacy, and social justice. This year, as a Dream DIrector in Washington, D.C., Kenya is dedicated to fostering critical thought and motivation in young people by exploring the futurism and social policy of the now!</p>

        <p>One of Daria’s dreams was to find a job that combined her love for storytelling, art, technology and education. And where better to fulfill a dream than at The Future Project? At the moment, Daria is working to build a national campaign around a feature length documentary produced by our very own board member, Ted Dintersmith. She also volunteered as a Future Coach for two years prior, is an internationally exhibited photographer, and is writing her first novel. </p>

        <p>Before Chris was even a Dream Director with The Future Project, he was already directing dreams for eighth graders in Boston through his work with the nonprofit, Apprentice Learning. He also served as a Program Director and Cultural Competency Advocate for Farm and Wilderness Summer Camps, creating a culture of “Anything is Possible” that was practiced in everything they did, while also creating programs and systems that promoted social justice education for young men. Chris loves to build. He loves to create. And he loves working with young people. So, he views Dream Directing as an opportunity to build and create with and for young people. This year in Brooklyn, NY, Chris strives to transform school into a place where people want to be. Schools can and should be fun, and if Chris can do anything to make staff and students in his community realize this, he will have succeeded.</p>

Her birth name is Patricia, but her friends call her Pat.  Her dearest and most intimate friends call her Patty. She was born and raised in Detroit and attended Detroit Public Schools, along with her twin and her older sister. She received a high school diploma from Cass Technical High School, a bachelor degree in Mass Communication from Western Michigan University, and a master’s degree in Educational Leadership from Wayne State University.
<br /><br />
Pat’s first teaching position provided her with a rich and fulfilling year-long experience in Tokushima, Japan. She always dreamed of traveling abroad. The exposure broadened her outlook on the world and made her a dream chaser. She travelled on to Europe, Africa, Mexico and many of the Caribbean Islands. She always wanted to give back to her city and state, so she taught in the classroom for 16 years and went on to become a Department Head, Assistant Principal, Assistant Superintendent, Executive Director, and Principal in various districts in the state of Michigan.<br />
<br /><br />
She was blessed to have been married for 22 yrs and she has 3 incredible humans who are her children.

      <div class="person-more-content">
        <p>After seeing so much of the world and attending nearly 10 schools growing up—she was born in South Korea, moved to Japan, and spent the second half of her childhood in both southern California and Tennessee—Kanya believes there is no more urgent challenge we must join together to meet than transforming the way young people grow up.
  <br><br>
For the past 13 years, Kanya has been teaching, mentoring, and supporting young people in learning how to transcend expectations and dare dreams others say are impossible. The oldest daughter of nationally recognized educators, Kanya—who was recently named a Glamour Magazine leading social entrepreneur and one of the top young female activists in America by Generation Progress—has always been happiest empowering those around her to succeed on their own terms.
  <br><br>
However, at Yale, where she led a campus mentorship initiative and a 200-person volunteer staff as the managing editor of the Yale Daily News, she realized something startling about New Haven’s youth: that most young people never realize this fact, and while educators always go into the field to develop and inspire others to be great, the system often does not give them space to focus on that.
  <br><br>
She went onto study anthropology to grasp what it would take to take a listening- and understanding-first approach to making change, and she interviewed dozens of change makers in the world devoted to transforming systems. Ultimately, Kanya saw that the most important ingredients in changing the world were listening, imagination, family, and purpose. And it was with these values in mind that she co-founded The Future Project in 2011, determined to unite her generation in a movement that felt like a family more than a fight—and focused on people, not policy, first.
  <br><br>
Prior to The Future Project, Kanya—a Presidential Scholar, Intel semi-finalist, and 2009 graduate of Yale—conducted HIV/AIDS research for a global-health NGO in Pune, India and served as the chief speechwriter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. As the toddler-aged founder of the Three Sister’s Club, Kanya is also passionate about her family, Scandal, the New York Times Modern Love column, and the one idea that keeps her up at night and drives everything she does: that there is a fearless humanitarian within us all, waiting to be let out.

      <div class="person-more-content">
        <p>For the past decade, Andrew has devoted himself to a two-word mission that inspires him every day: waging possibility. 
<br><br>
In 2009, he was speechwriting at the White House when he began to mentor a student in a D.C. and asked him a simple question: what’s your dream? When the student said he had never been asked that question before, Andrew realized that the education crisis he had been studying for so many years—whether up close as a city reporter in New Haven or as a student at Yale—might be a lot simpler at heart than we’ve led ourselves to believe.
<br><br>
As he poured through research and spoke with dozens of teachers, principals, and students, a theme emerged: students (and teachers) on average were not being inspired by schools to learn, let alone to lead extraordinary lives. In too many cases in the toughest environments, schools became places of despair and apathy. Teachers, too, were checking out amid schools reforms that factor in their voice. Students weren’t learning how to be powerful, and they rarely found what brought them alive. And without these ingredients, he realized, not even great reforms could ever work. With Kanya, he got to work.
<br><br>
Prior to The Future Project, Andrew—a Forbes "30 Under 30" Social Entrepreneur and Ashoka Fellow—wrote speeches for Attorney General Eric Holder and Vice President Joe Biden, and he soaked up everything he could about social entrepreneurship while working as a senior entrepreneur at Ashoka. A Marshall Scholar, the 130th Editor in Chief of the Yale Daily News, and a magna cum laude graduate of Yale with political science major that focused on education, Andrew is passionate not only about education, but also about Oldies Music, theme songs, American history, oratory, and, above all, the magical power of passionate teams to change the world.

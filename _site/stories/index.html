<p>We give young people the opportunity to discover their potential and build the skills they need to better their lives and world, starting in the place that’s supposed to prepare us for life: high school.</p>

      <div class="article-content"><h2 id="our-country-is-uninspired-unfulfilled-and-losing-hope">Our country is uninspired, unfulfilled, and losing hope.</h2>

<p>America is supposed to be a place of possibility. But amid major challenges, our society has become more pessimistic than ever before. Worst of all, millions of young people are growing up hopeless and disengaged, without the belief or the skills they need to lead in the 21st century.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Millions of Americans are living unhappy, unfulfilled lives and don’t have faith in the future.
    <ul>
      <li>2/3 say they are unhappy with their lives.</li>
      <li>More than half say they are unfulfilled in their jobs.</li>
      <li>Nearly 2/3 believe the next generation will be economically worse off that they are today.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is most dangerously true for young people, who do not believe they can build a better future.
    <ul>
      <li>7/10 young people say they are uninspired and unmotivated.</li>
      <li>5/10 say they are not hopeful about their futures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is being reinforced by schools across America, which are designed to prepare students for the past, not the future.
    <ul>
      <li>Most aspects of today’s public schools in America were designed in 1892.</li>
      <li>Students lose more than 90% of their creative capacity during their school years.</li>
      <li>65% of students will be employed in jobs that don’t exist yet and for which schools are not preparing them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>This is causing young people to disengage at staggering numbers and never discover and unleash their full potential.
    <ul>
      <li>Only 55% of students are engaged in learning at school.</li>
      <li>1.2 million students drop out of American high schools every year (that’s 7000 each day).</li>
      <li>Suspension rates have more than doubled in the past four decades, contributing to a strong school to prison pipeline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

        <p>For the past decade, Andrew has devoted himself to a two-word mission that inspires him every day: waging possibility. In 2009, he was speechwriting at the White House when he began to mentor a student in a D.C. and asked him a simple question: what’s your dream? When the student said he had never been asked that question before, Andrew realized that the education crisis he had been studying for so many years—whether up close as a city reporter in New Haven or as a student at Yale—might be a lot simpler at heart than we’ve led ourselves to believe.As he poured through research and spoke with dozens of teachers, principals, and students, a theme emerged: students (and teachers) on average were not being inspired by schools to learn, let alone to lead extraordinary lives. In too many cases in the toughest environments, schools became places of despair and apathy. Teachers, too, were checking out amid schools reforms that factor in their voice. Students weren’t learning how to be powerful, and they rarely found what brought them alive. And without these ingredients, he realized, not even great reforms could ever work. With Kanya, he got to work.Prior to The Future Project, Andrew—a Forbes “30 Under 30” Social Entrepreneur and Ashoka Fellow—wrote speeches for Attorney General Eric Holder and Vice President Joe Biden, and he soaked up everything he could about social entrepreneurship while working as a senior entrepreneur at Ashoka. A Marshall Scholar, the 130th Editor in Chief of the Yale Daily News, and a magna cum laude graduate of Yale with political science major that focused on education, Andrew is passionate not only about education, but also about Oldies Music, theme songs, American history, oratory, and, above all, the magical power of passionate teams to change the world.</p>

        <p>After seeing so much of the world and attending nearly 10 schools growing up—she was born in South Korea, moved to Japan, and spent the second half of her childhood in both southern California and Tennessee—Kanya believes there is no more urgent challenge we must join together to meet than transforming the way young people grow up.  For the past 13 years, Kanya has been teaching, mentoring, and supporting young people in learning how to transcend expectations and dare dreams others say are impossible. The oldest daughter of nationally recognized educators, Kanya—who was recently named a Glamour Magazine leading social entrepreneur and one of the top young female activists in America by Generation Progress—has always been happiest empowering those around her to succeed on their own terms.  However, at Yale, where she led a campus mentorship initiative and a 200-person volunteer staff as the managing editor of the Yale Daily News, she realized something startling about New Haven’s youth: that most young people never realize this fact, and while educators always go into the field to develop and inspire others to be great, the system often does not give them space to focus on that.  She went onto study anthropology to grasp what it would take to take a listening- and understanding-first approach to making change, and she interviewed dozens of change makers in the world devoted to transforming systems. Ultimately, Kanya saw that the most important ingredients in changing the world were listening, imagination, family, and purpose. And it was with these values in mind that she co-founded The Future Project in 2011, determined to unite her generation in a movement that felt like a family more than a fight—and focused on people, not policy, first.  Prior to The Future Project, Kanya—a Presidential Scholar, Intel semi-finalist, and 2009 graduate of Yale—conducted HIV/AIDS research for a global-health NGO in Pune, India and served as the chief speechwriter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg. As the toddler-aged founder of the Three Sister’s Club, Kanya is also passionate about her family, Scandal, the New York Times Modern Love column, and the one idea that keeps her up at night and drives everything she does: that there is a fearless humanitarian within us all, waiting to be let out.</p>

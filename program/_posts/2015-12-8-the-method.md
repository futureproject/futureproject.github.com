## Students build Future Projects that Change their Schools and World

Dream Directors provide coaching, offer courses, and apply culture-change techniques to create impact on two levels: building will and skill in students and improving the culture of the school.

1. ### Improving School Culture
  After conducting a school-wide Possibility Audit, Dream Directors recruit a Dream Team of students and staff who create a school change strategy and build Future Projects to implement it, enrolling hundreds along the way.

2. ### Building Will & Skill in Students
  Dream Directors work with dozens of students throughout the year to discover a dream worth pursuing bring it to life by building Future Project that can be a campaign, a new club or organization, a product, or an event.

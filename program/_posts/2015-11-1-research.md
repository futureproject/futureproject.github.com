## Our method is built on cutting-edge research

Dream Directors are more than just natural leaders. They're also rigorously trained at our signature Dream Academy in our core methodology for unlocking potential. Our method combines the best scientifically supported techniques from across multiple research domains to build will and skill in students and transform school culture.

  ### Purpose
  Purpose in adolescence is defined as having a far reaching goal that is both an individual’s search for meaning but that also contributes to the world beyond the self. Our Dream Directors actively support students to identify their purpose and to develop projects or organize events that engage it. We’re excited to be working with Bill Damon of The Stanford Center on Adolescence in our efforts to develop purpose in young people.

  ### Sparks
  Sparks are defined as an activity or cause that generates passion, joy, energy, and purpose in someone. Research on sparks indicates that youth who have an adult who supports their sparks are more successful in school and beyond. We’re excited to be using cutting edge instruments from the Search Institute to assess spark in relation to other key areas like growth-mindset.

  ### Growth Mindset
  Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed, but it can also apply to seeing potential for growth in many aspects of oneself or the surrounding world. Students that exhibit growth mindset have an innate desire to learn, and are more likely to embrace challenges, learn from criticisms, and persist in the face of setbacks in and out of academic settings. As Dream Directors work with students to pursue their purpose and sparks, the dream directors explicitly emphasize how to have a growth mindset regarding the inevitable challenges in life. In developing growth mindset, we've partnered with Carol Dweck, growth mindset pioneer and author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success.

  ### Hope
  In research, hope involves the optimistic belief and ability to initiate and sustain progress towards goals. It is intertwined with self-efficacy and growth-mindset. The Future Project cultivates a positive atmosphere with the intent to encourage students to be optimistic about their future. We’re excited to partner Shane Lopez, Senior Scientist at Gallup and author of Making Hope Happen.

  ### Self-efficacy
  Self-efficacy is one’s belief in his or her ability to pursue and attain goals. A central goal of every Dream Director is to empower the students they work with, and we’re seeing results: participants consistently report feeling more confident and able to pursue their goals due to their experience with The Future Project.


- ![SEL](/img/program-researchicon-sel.png)

  ### Social Emotional Learning (SEL)
  Students who master the five main SEL skills—self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, responsible decision making, and relationship skills—are better able to operate within social contexts and generate support from the people and resources around them. We’re thrilled to be working with Tim Shriver and The Collaborative for Academic and Social Emotional Learning (CASEL) to better develop these skills in our students.

  ### 21st century skills
  The rapid changes in society and technology have inspired a renewed definition of skills graduates need to succeed in the workforce; these are collectively known as 21st century skills. Among these skills, The Future Project focus primarily on creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking. To learn more about 21st century skills, visit Partnership for 21st Century Learning.

- ![Zest](/img/program-researchicon-zest.png)

  ### Zest
  Zest is an emergent construct in psychology research representing the approach to life with excitement, energy, and anticipation. We’re proud to emphasizes zest in our programming, and are thrilled to see the development of zest in our students and schools. To learn about the latest with zest, explore the research of Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman.

- ![School Culture](/img/program-researchicon-school.png)

  ### School culture
  School culture is comprised of the rituals, values, and norms that define a school. At The Future Project, we believe the success and happiness of individuals is influenced by school culture and visa versa, so our work actively accounts for this interplay between the individual and the collective. To learn more about the power of school culture, explore the research of David H. Hargreaves, Kent D. Peterson, and Terrence E. Deal.

In addition to these nine key areas of research that inform The Future Project's model, there are other valuable constructs that inform our work: goal-setting, grit, self-determination theory, inspiration, intrinsic motivation, collaborative leadership, student engagement, and imagination.

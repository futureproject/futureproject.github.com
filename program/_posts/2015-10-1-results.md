## Dream Directors are unlocking potential in students and schools nationwide.

What happens when a Dream Director embeds in a school and starts working with students? Four years of field testing our model have demonstrated that a Dream Director can be transformative to both students and their schools. Each year, Dream Directors provide students with thousands of hours of training and coaching. They expose students to dozens of new fields and career paths, and help them build critical skills. 

In the process, they transform the culture of an entire school, leading to better attendance, increased student engagement, and an improved school environment continues to impact students' lives after they leave school.

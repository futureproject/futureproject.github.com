  <p>
  A Dream Director is a transformational leader who is assigned to one high school – and committed to unleashing the passion and purpose, curiosity and imagination, courage and grit of everyone in it. Dream Directors are entrepreneurs, coaches, organizers and educators. They are midwives of dreams — and warriors of possibility. They are creative rebels. They are idealists. They are pragmatists. Above all, they are leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
  For this role, we are looking for candidates who are ultimate possibility thinkers – who can quickly see the potential in any young person and adult, and work rigorously to unleash it.  They listen deeply, work with others to co-create a compelling and bold vision, and energize groups and communities to take action. They thrive in formal and informal settings, capable of identifying and connecting with decision-makers and individuals with influence. They are driven to improve, get results, compete, and innovate. They can adapt their approach when necessary, and appreciate opposition as an opportunity to learn, grow, or improve their strategy. They can manage multiple projects and teams simultaneously, break down complex problems into logical work, and adapt to chaos and circumstance. They see themselves as a leader of others – from forming a team of students and communicating a clear and compelling vision and mission, to fostering a high level of cooperation and collaboration among the many groups of adults in the building.
  </p>
  <p>
  We are looking for potential Dream Directors to serve in schools in Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, Los Angeles, Naugatuck and Norwalk, Ct., Newark, New Haven, NYC, Oakland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.  — starting in June 2017.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>The Fine Print</strong><br>
  Full-Time. Competitive Salary. Health Insurance. Emphasis on professional development. Flexible Hours. Background Checks. Bachelor’s Degree Preferred, but no qualified candidates will be turned away due to education.

  <p>A Dream Director is a new job for a new century. A transformational leader who is assigned to one high school—and committed to unleashing the passion and purpose, curiosity and imagination, courage and grit of everyone in it—the Dream Director is many things in one. They are entrepreneurs. They are coaches. They are imagineers. They are coalition-builders. They are organizers. They are educators. They are midwives of dreams—and warriors of possibility. They are creative rebels. They are idealists. They are pragmatists. Above all, they are leaders.</p>

  <h3>The Impact of Future Projects </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Mariely Garcia, a student at Richard R. Green High School of Teaching was tired of seeing young people struggle with low self-worth, so she launched <a href="http://vimeo.com/64084976">The Perfect Revolution</a> to unite the nation in acceptance, courage, and love.
    </li>
    <li>
    Bryan Stromer, Lena Jacobs and a team of NYC Lab School students built "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/nycownit/">Own It</a>," a campaign to end bullying by encouraging students to own what makes them weird.
    </li>
    <li>
    Mercedes Dunkley, a student at New Haven Academy, created “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZIkVRcDqVI">AirTime</a>,” a school-wide transformation from “throwing dirt” to “spitting soap” to put an end to negative language at school.
    </li>
    <li>
    Raenuka Reneau, who lost her mom as a teenager, wanted to help young people going through loss, so she created <a href="/videos#flutter">Flutter</a>, a website to help people share their stories of loss and find something new.
    </li>
    <li>
    Finally, see how building Future Projects has <a href="/videos#innovation">changed the lives</a> of many of our students.

Hill Regional Career High School<br>New Haven
</p>
 <p><b>8AM -</b> Frank, Christian, Sarah, Laura, and I (the New Haven TFP team) convene at The Grove, our downtown office space, for a weekly check-in meeting. 
<br><br>
<b>9AM -</b> Citywide updates, problem solving techniques, upcoming dates, coffee, etc. 
<br><br>
<b>10AM -</b> After walking from The Grove to Career HS, I put my stuff down in my office, go through emails, and check out the Dream Team Instagram updates.
<br><br>
<b>11AM -</b> Lunch waves bring big groups of students into my office each day. Angelique and Jaquan dance to Usher (seriously) while Rafi, Jamari, Barshawn, and Adam work on planning an afterschool Open Mic next Friday. 
<br><br>
<b>12PM -</b> Milan and Justice come visit me at B-Lunch to ask if I have any leftover stickers from yesterday's First Day of Spring campaign. They leave with lime green #SPRUNG stickers on their phones. During C-Lunch I help two sophomores finish applications for summer jobs. 
<br><br>
<b>1PM -</b> 4th period I have a meeting with a student from the school's senior project class, Jamal. He's planning an Art Show at Career, and we go over the list of classmates he's asked to contribute work. 
<br><br>
<b>2PM -</b> [This isn't a daily occurrence!] A student I know well comes to my office really upset about an ongoing problem among a group of her friends. We have some pretzels and talk and, when she's collected, I walk her back to class. 
<br><br>
<b>3PM -</b> I don't have an official afterschool session or a club meeting on Fridays, so it's usually a good day to bring students into the New Haven community. I haven't got anything lined up for today, so I get to just hang out with the students who stop by before they leave for the weekend.
<br><br>
<b>4PM -</b> I find Mike, the Building &amp; Grounds Manager, before I leave to ask about getting his help for an event next week. One of Kleaver's Dreamers calls me to ask about getting started on an art project!
<br><br>
<b>5PM -</b> I leave Career and meet a friend of mine for coffee. He's a med student here at Yale and is coming to Career to speak at "Choices Day" next month, so he wants to talk about how that will go.

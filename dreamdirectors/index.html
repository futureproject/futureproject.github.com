<article id="about_the_position" class='sized-narrow'>
  <p>A Dream Director is a new job for a new century. A transformational leader who is assigned to one high school—and committed to unleashing the passion and purpose, curiosity and imagination, courage and grit of everyone in it—the Dream Director is many things in one. They are entrepreneurs. They are coaches. They are imagineers. They are coalition-builders. They are organizers. They are educators. They are midwives of dreams—and warriors of possibility. They are creative rebels. They are idealists. They are pragmatists. Above all, they are leaders.</p>
  
  <p>We designed the new role of the Dream Director over the past three years in concert with thousands of students, teachers, principals, academics, and social entrepreneurs across America—and we solidified it by holding sacred a simple principle: that human values belong at the center of a school—and, more broadly, American education.</p>

<p>Dream Directors are embedded in schools, and work in tandem with students and faculty members to reimagine them as places of possibility and action. They provide action-based coaching and skill-centered learning experiences. They support students in small groups, and one-on-one, to launch their dreams. And they collaborate day after day with their principal to transform culture, space, and policy.</p>

<p>We believe that the people within schools, from students to teachers to custodians to principals, are ready to do extraordinary things. The Dream Director stands for the possibility of all people, and they step up daily to the steep but urgent challenge of reimagining the status quo.  The results of this work takes many inspiring forms, from student Future Projects—campaigns, organizations, products, events, and so much more—to physically redesigned schools and entirely new classes at the school. Students gain the will to succeed and the skills to lead. Schools become thrilling. New connections are formed within a school and across a community. Ripples of hope are sent forth from classrooms to community to city. </p>

<p>If you believe anything is possible, then you may be a Dream Director. We imagine Dream Directors one day in every school in America. Apply now to be one of the first.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2016 Recruitment</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for Dream Directors to serve in schools in each of our seven cities — Detroit, MI, New Haven, CT, New York, NY, Newark, NJ, Philadelphia, PA, San Francisco, CA, and Washington, D.C.—starting in Fall 2015.</p>

<p><strong>The Fine Print</strong></p>

<p>Full-Time. Competitive Salary. Health Insurance. Flexible Time. Bachelor’s Degree Preferred, but no qualified candidates will be turned away due to education.</p>

    <li>
    Mariely Garcia, a student at Richard R. Green High School of Teaching was tired of seeing young people struggle with low self-worth, so she launched <a href="http://vimeo.com/64084976">The Perfect Revolution</a> to unite the nation in acceptance, courage, and love.
    </li>
    <li>

    <li>
    Mercedes Dunkley, a student at New Haven Academy, created “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZIkVRcDqVI">AirTime</a>,” a school-wide transformation from “throwing dirt” to “spitting soap” to put an end to negative language at school.
    </li>
    <li>
    Raenuka Reneau, who lost her mom as a teenager, wanted to help young people going through loss, so she created <a href="/videos#flutter">Flutter</a>, a website to help people share their stories of loss and find something new.

</p>
 <p><b>8AM -</b> Frank, Christian, Sarah, Laura, and I (the New Haven TFP team) convene at The Grove, our downtown office space, for a weekly check-in meeting. 
<br><br>
<b>9AM -</b> Citywide updates, problem solving techniques, upcoming dates, coffee, etc. 
<br><br>
<b>10AM -</b> After walking from The Grove to Career HS, I put my stuff down in my office, go through emails, and check out the Dream Team Instagram updates.
<br><br>
<b>11AM -</b> Lunch waves bring big groups of students into my office each day. Angelique and Jaquan dance to Usher (seriously) while Rafi, Jamari, Barshawn, and Adam work on planning an afterschool Open Mic next Friday. 
<br><br>
<b>12PM -</b> Milan and Justice come visit me at B-Lunch to ask if I have any leftover stickers from yesterday's First Day of Spring campaign. They leave with lime green #SPRUNG stickers on their phones. During C-Lunch I help two sophomores finish applications for summer jobs. 
<br><br>
<b>1PM -</b> 4th period I have a meeting with a student from the school's senior project class, Jamal. He's planning an Art Show at Career, and we go over the list of classmates he's asked to contribute work. 
<br><br>
<b>2PM -</b> [This isn't a daily occurrence!] A student I know well comes to my office really upset about an ongoing problem among a group of her friends. We have some pretzels and talk and, when she's collected, I walk her back to class. 
<br><br>
<b>3PM -</b> I don't have an official afterschool session or a club meeting on Fridays, so it's usually a good day to bring students into the New Haven community. I haven't got anything lined up for today, so I get to just hang out with the students who stop by before they leave for the weekend.
<br><br>
<b>4PM -</b> I find Mike, the Building &amp; Grounds Manager, before I leave to ask about getting his help for an event next week. One of Kleaver's Dreamers calls me to ask about getting started on an art project!
<br><br>
<b>5PM -</b> I leave Career and meet a friend of mine for coffee. He's a med student here at Yale and is coming to Career to speak at "Choices Day" next month, so he wants to talk about how that will go.

  <p>
  A Dream Director is a transformational leader who is assigned to one high school—and committed to unleashing the passion and purpose, curiosity and imagination, courage and grit of everyone in it—the Dream Director is many things in one. They are entrepreneurs. They are coaches. They are imagineers. They are coalition-builders. They are organizers. They are educators. They are midwives of dreams—and warriors of possibility. They are creative rebels. They are idealists. They are pragmatists. Above all, they are leaders.
  </p>
  <p>
  A candidate that is perfect for the role is the ultimate dreamer in action. They can express a compelling vision and energize individuals and communities to take action. They thrive in formal and informal settings, capable of identifying and connecting with decision-makers and individuals with influence. They are driven to improve, get results, compete, and innovate. They can adapt their approach when necessary, and appreciate opposition as an opportunity to learn, grow, or improve their strategy. They can manage multiple projects and teams simultaneously. They see themselves as a leader of others—from forming a team of students and communicating a clear and compelling vision and mission, to fostering a high level of cooperation and collaboration among the many groups of adults in the building. 
  </p>
  <p>
  We are looking for Dream Directors to serve in schools in Detroit, MI, New Haven, CT, New York, NY, Newark, NJ, Philadelphia, PA, and Washington, D.C.— starting in May 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>The Fine Print</strong><br>
  Full-Time. Competitive Salary. Health Insurance. Emphasis on professional development. Flexible Hours. Background Checks. Bachelor’s Degree Preferred, but no qualified candidates will be turned away due to education.

<article id="how_they_do_it" class='sized-narrow'>
  <h3>How They Do It</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Listen to the members of a school community to understand the core needs and common dream of the school; and with the partnership of the principal, faculty and Dream Team, develop and execute a strategy to imbue possibility, passion, power and purpose throughout the school community.
    </li>
    <li>
      Coach students to dream up, design, and build Future Projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Develop and provide leadership, entrepreneurship, and mindset training for the Dream Team.
    </li>
    <li>
      Facilitate learning experiences that develop critical 21st century skills—from motivation to communication to collaboration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work with local Dream Directors to plan and execute city-wide experiences for students, and to develop an understanding (and eventually mastery) of the art and science of dream directing.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gather robust data, accounting and notes to evaluate the most effective tools, programs, processes and experiences; and work with The Future Project Lab to develop and execute innovative approaches to assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pursue personal passions and dreams to serve as a tangible example of what’s possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Travel within city for peer observations and out of state for professional development intensives. At the Future Project, the development of our Dream Directors is a top priority. And so, while they work in schools and gain practical experience with the work, they also develop their mastery in the art and science of Dream Directing through Dream Academy. This includes weekly 'labs' with the Dream Directors in their cities, 'seminars' and 'studios' that connect them to Dream Directors across the country, and periodic multi-day intensives that bring them together to learn as a community. 
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Eve King</h4>
<p>
Hill Regional Career High School<br>New Haven
</p>
 <p><b>8AM -</b> Frank, Christian, Sarah, Laura, and I (the New Haven TFP team) convene at The Grove, our downtown office space, for a weekly check-in meeting. 
<br><br>
<b>9AM -</b> Citywide updates, problem solving techniques, upcoming dates, coffee, etc. 
<br><br>
<b>10AM -</b> After walking from The Grove to Career HS, I put my stuff down in my office, go through emails, and check out the Dream Team Instagram updates.
<br><br>
<b>11AM -</b> Lunch waves bring big groups of students into my office each day. Angelique and Jaquan dance to Usher (seriously) while Rafi, Jamari, Barshawn, and Adam work on planning an afterschool Open Mic next Friday. 
<br><br>
<b>12PM -</b> Milan and Justice come visit me at B-Lunch to ask if I have any leftover stickers from yesterday's First Day of Spring campaign. They leave with lime green #SPRUNG stickers on their phones. During C-Lunch I help two sophomores finish applications for summer jobs. 
<br><br>
<b>1PM -</b> 4th period I have a meeting with a student from the school's senior project class, Jamal. He's planning an Art Show at Career, and we go over the list of classmates he's asked to contribute work. 
<br><br>
<b>2PM -</b> [This isn't a daily occurrence!] A student I know well comes to my office really upset about an ongoing problem among a group of her friends. We have some pretzels and talk and, when she's collected, I walk her back to class. 
<br><br>
<b>3PM -</b> I don't have an official afterschool session or a club meeting on Fridays, so it's usually a good day to bring students into the New Haven community. I haven't got anything lined up for today, so I get to just hang out with the students who stop by before they leave for the weekend.
<br><br>
<b>4PM -</b> I find Mike, the Building &amp; Grounds Manager, before I leave to ask about getting his help for an event next week. One of Kleaver's Dreamers calls me to ask about getting started on an art project!
<br><br>
<b>5PM -</b> I leave Career and meet a friend of mine for coffee. He's a med student here at Yale and is coming to Career to speak at "Choices Day" next month, so he wants to talk about how that will go.

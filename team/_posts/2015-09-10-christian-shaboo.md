As the Dream Director at High School in the Community in New Haven, CT, Christian has used his passion for the arts to transform the halls of the school into a community art gallery, and brought scores of alumni back to the school to support current students. In these and many other ways, heâ€™s been working with students, teachers and alumni to find ways they can reimagine, recreate, and completely own the identity of their school.

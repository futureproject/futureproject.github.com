A lifelong film buff, Eden was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. He believes that every living thing–from orcas in captivity to introverted high school students–deserves to be heard and understood, and that cinema provides that voice. He aims to inspire every young person in the world by expanding the reach of independent films that deserve to be seen.

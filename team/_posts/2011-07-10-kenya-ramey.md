As a 4th generation teacher-scholar, Kenya’s work is articulated by the African Proverb, “She who learns, teaches.” This paradigm is influenced by the historiography of indigenous cultures of the world and contemporary movements. As an educator, Kenya has serviced New York City, Philadelphia, and several international communities: Ghana, Tanzania, Ethiopia, South Africa, Cuba, Nigeria, Brazil, India and Puerto Rico. She has always understood her learnings in Africana Studies, along with her professional experiences and civic engagement to be manifestations of her essential commitment to education, cultural advocacy, and social justice. This year, as a Dream DIrector in Washington, D.C., Kenya is dedicated to fostering critical thought and motivation in young people by exploring the futurism and social policy of the now!

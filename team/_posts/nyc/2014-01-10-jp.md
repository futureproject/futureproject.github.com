JP thrives off of creating something that wasn’t there before. He wants to see students encounter a world full of opportunities beyond their present realities. Prior to Dream Directing with The Future Project, JP  worked with high school students at Harlem Children’s Zone's Promise Academy II Charter School. He also writes and develops music through his own production entity, Peach and Power Media. Now, as a Dream Director in the Bronx, JP has the opportunity to live a more integrated life-- allowing his own dreams to mix seamlessly with his work, and enabling young people to do the same.

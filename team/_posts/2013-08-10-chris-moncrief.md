Before Chris was even a Dream Director with The Future Project, he was already directing dreams for eighth graders in Boston through his work with the nonprofit, Apprentice Learning. He also served as a Program Director and Cultural Competency Advocate for Farm and Wilderness Summer Camps, creating a culture of “Anything is Possible” that was practiced in everything they did, while also creating programs and systems that promoted social justice education for young men. Chris loves to build. He loves to create. And he loves working with young people. So, he views Dream Directing as an opportunity to build and create with and for young people. This year in Brooklyn, NY, Chris strives to transform school into a place where people want to be. Schools can and should be fun, and if Chris can do anything to make staff and students in his community realize this, he will have succeeded.

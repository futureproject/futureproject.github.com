Jesseâ€™s uncontainable passion for helping others discover and realize their dreams has led him to serve in youth empowerment organizations across the United States and in countries such as Brazil, China, and Japan. As the first person in his family to attend college, Jesse graduated from Harvard University (with honors) from where he traveled to Mexico City as a Fulbright Scholar. He has now returned to his home state of California as a Dream Director and is excited to utilize his distinctive style of inspiration in order to shine the spotlight on the greatness in those around him.

Before having the title, Dream Director, Hakim was working in the Public Health field as a Health Resource Coordinator and Educator. His work centered around advocating for black and brown communities, and ensuring they have all the access, tools, and resources to lead healthy long lives. Because how can we dream if we can't live? Hakim views himself as a lifelong Dream Director, working at the intersection of skill set development, vision casting, planning and training. Over two years ago, he stated that his dream was to make the dreams of other people possible. And now here he is. This year, in Philadelphia, PA, Hakim will be focused on unlocking the passion of the many students who have been weighed down by the reality and hardships of their environments. He wants them to see that the impossible actually IS possible!

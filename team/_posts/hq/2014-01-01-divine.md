Divine’s been a social entrepreneur ever since he was seventeen, when he turned his parents’ house in Brooklyn into a community center for other young people in the neighborhood. Ever since, he’s been dedicated to creating a new generation of leaders, a charge he’s taken to his work as a Social Imagineer for The Future Project.

Ben was attracted to the role of the Dream Director because of his desire to support the growth and education of young people outside the classroom. Acknowledging that high school is a formative time in a young person’s life, Ben hopes to be a great resource in helping to sculpt individuals’ concepts of self and visions for the future. Prior to joining The Future Project as a Dream Director, Ben was supporting the growth and development of the charter sector in Newark, NJ to ensure that students and families had options in education. Now, in his school in downtown New York City, Ben wants to see students understand the possibilities that already exist in the spaces they move through. In his work, he hopes to facilitate platforms for the student voice, and provide individuals with new measures of success.
